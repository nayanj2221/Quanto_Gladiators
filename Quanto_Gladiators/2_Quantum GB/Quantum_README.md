# üåå Quantum Galton Board Simulation

Welcome to the **Quantum Galton Board Simulation**, which represents Task 2 of the Quantum Walks and Monte Carlo project. This initiative is proudly submitted for WISER 2025 in collaboration with the National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL). Our simulation harnesses the power of quantum walks using Qiskit to model random walks, offering potential speed-ups for Monte Carlo neutron transport‚Äîa transformative advancement for NNL‚Äôs reactor design and safety innovations!

## ‚ú® Overview

The Quantum Galton Board elevates the classic concept of the Galton Board to a new dimension! Instead of traditional balls tumbling randomly, this simulation employs quantum superposition and interference to explore multiple paths simultaneously, resulting in unique and intricate distributions. This innovative approach mirrors the principles of Monte Carlo neutron transport, where neutrons scatter through reactor materials. The `quantum_galton_box.ipynb` notebook utilizes Qiskit to execute quantum walk simulations, aiming to enhance neutron flux predictions for NNL‚Äôs nuclear research.

## üöÄ Application to Monte Carlo Neutron Transport

This quantum simulation significantly enhances neutron transport, aligning seamlessly with NNL‚Äôs mission:

- **Quantum Neutron Scattering**: Quantum walks simulate numerous neutron paths concurrently, accurately reflecting their scattering through reactor materials such as uranium and graphite.
- **Monte Carlo Speed-Up**: By leveraging quantum circuits, this simulation promises near-quadratic speed-ups over classical methods, as highlighted by Montanaro (arXiv:1504.06987), thereby improving neutron flux and shielding calculations.
- **NNL Advantage**: Faster simulations can optimize reactor designs, enhance safety protocols, and reduce computational costs, making this approach invaluable for nuclear research.
- **Building on Classical Foundations**: This project builds upon the classical simulation (1_Classical GB), showcasing the advantages of quantum methods for addressing large-scale neutron transport challenges.

- Matplotlib (3.9.2)

You can install these dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r ../../requirements.txt
```
## Run the Simulation
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook with the command:
```bash
jupyter notebook quantum_galton_box.ipynb
```
2.Execute all cells to simulate quantum walks for 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 layers, with a default of 10,000 shots.

## Outputs
Explore the `results_quantum/` directory for plots displaying quantum distributions that resemble enhanced neutron flux patterns. A highlight is `quantum_galton_box_10_layers.png`, which showcases a unique curve that reflects quantum-enhanced neutron scattering.

## How It Works
### Mechanics
The notebook utilizes Qiskit to create quantum circuits, applying Hadamard gates for superposition and measuring outcomes to simulate quantum walks effectively.

### Parameters
- Layers: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 (representing quantum steps).
- Shots: 10,000 (the number of measurement runs, default).
## Output
The histograms display probability distributions that differ from classical binomial distributions due to quantum interference, effectively mimicking complex neutron behavior!

### Complexity
- *Time Complexity*: O(layers * shots), with the potential for quantum speedup.
- *Space Complexity*: O(shots) for storing measurement results.
