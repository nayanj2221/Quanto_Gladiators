Great! Based on your detailed project and the WISER presentation structure, here's a **ready-to-use script and slide outline** for your 3-minute **Quantum Galton Box Simulation** presentation.

## ✅ Presentation Title

**Simulating Quantum Walks & Monte Carlo Using a Galton Box**
**Team: Quanto Gladiators**
**WISER Quantum Project**
(Include WISER logo on all slides)

---

### 🔹 Slide 1: Problem Statement (Title: “Why Simulate Particle Behavior?”)

**Time: \~30 seconds**

**Script:**

> Every day, scientists simulate complex systems like neutron transport in reactors, quantum particles in noisy environments, or even high-dimensional financial models.
> These simulations are computationally intensive on classical machines, especially in quantum-scale behavior.
> That’s where our project comes in — using a quantum Galton Box as a simplified but powerful simulation of Monte Carlo behavior with quantum circuits.

---

### 🔹 Slide 2: Our Solution (Title: “Quantum Galton Box Simulator”)

**Time: \~60–90 seconds**

**Script:**

> We built a multi-layered simulation toolkit to model and compare classical and quantum versions of the Galton Box, or “Plinko.”
> We implemented four simulation models:
> ✅ Classical Galton Box
> ✅ Ideal Quantum Galton Box
> ✅ Noisy Quantum Galton Box (using Qiskit Aer)
> ✅ Biased Quantum Galton Box

> These models helped us understand how randomness, quantum interference, noise, and bias affect outcome distributions.

> Using Qiskit, Matplotlib, and SciPy, we visualized distributions layer-wise (5 to 25 layers), and compared them using advanced statistical metrics:
> • Total Variation Distance
> • KL Divergence
> • Wasserstein Distance

> We even turned our simulation into an **educational quantum toolkit with an interactive dashboard**, built using Jupyter widgets and deployed via Voilà.

---

### 🔹 Slide 3: Results & Impact (Title: “Results That Reveal Quantum Behavior”)

**Time: \~30–45 seconds**

**Script:**

> Our simulations clearly showed:
> • Classical distributions form a binomial curve
> • Quantum models show interference oscillations
> • Noisy systems lose sharpness due to decoherence
> • Bias shifts the entire distribution center

> The results were validated visually and quantitatively.
> 📊 The toolkit serves as both a learning platform and a research starting point for Monte Carlo quantum simulation — relevant in physics, finance, and AI optimization.

### 🔹 Slide 4: Future Scope (Title: “Beyond the Box”)

**Time: \~30 seconds**

**Script:**

> We aim to extend our work by:
>
> * Running simulations on real IBM Quantum Hardware
> * Scaling to 2D Galton boards or continuous variables
> * Integrating with PDE solvers or using VQE/Quantum Walks

> Limitations included hardware access and simulator speed for large circuits — but with real access or batching, our system is ready to evolve.

| Slide | Visual Suggestions                                                    |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Diagram of Galton Box + text overlay "Simulating particle behavior"   |
| 2     | Side-by-side circuit diagrams or method blocks (Classical vs Quantum) |
| 3     | 1–2 example graphs showing oscillations, shifts, and binomial curves  |

## ✅ Final Tips:

* **Rehearse**: Stick to \~30s per slide
* **Keep visual flow**: 1–2 graphs max per slide
* **Mention WISER Quantum Project on every slide**
* **Use consistent font, dark text on light background**
